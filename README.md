# mySelfSimilarFractal
Uses Python Turtle to draw a iterations of a self-similar fractal design

## Description

I had wanted to design a self-similar fractal based on a zig-zag around a zig-zig, with 60Â° angle, since I like triangles.  The iterations do not perfect fit on top of one another, so the next iteration is getting instructions for how to turn from the previous, rather than drawing over it. The different iterations do fit into each other like puzzle pieces though.

I had designed the fractal by doing lots of drawing by hand, and then wrote the Turtle code based on my analysis of the pattern I had come up with.  I had created this file in 2012, as a senior in college, around the time when I first learned how to use recursive functions to make cool designs with Turtle.

I have had to update it since 2012, since Python has updated since then.  

## Installation

After opening and running the module in IDLE, the Turtle window should pop up.  The main function to run is called `fractal`, and it has 2 main arguments: the depth of iteration and size of a segment. It also has 2 optional arguments for filling the inside.

Here's some examples:
